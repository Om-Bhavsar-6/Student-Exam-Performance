 Student Performance in Exams - Data Analysis & Visualization

 Project Overview
This project explores the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset from Kaggle to analyze patterns in student academic scores across math, reading, and writing. Using Python, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, various visualizations and feature engineering techniques reveal insights on demographics, test preparation, and performance inequalities.

 Dataset
The dataset includes students' demographic info and test scores:
- Gender
- Race/Ethnicity
- Parental Level of Education
- Lunch Type
- Test Preparation Course
- Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing

 Key Visualizations
- Violin plots depicting score variability across ethnic groups
- Swarm plots comparing relative performance by lunch and test prep
- Heatmaps showing subject-wise score correlations by gender
- Outlier analysis to identify unique student performance patterns

 Insights
- Strong positive correlation exists among scores across subjects
- No pronounced score outliers for high math and low reading thresholds
- Test preparation boosts performance more significantly for students with reduced lunch
- Some demographic groups display greater score variability, suggesting targeted support needs

 How to Run
1. Download `StudentsPerformance.csv` from Kaggle and place it in this directory.
2. Open and run `student_exams_eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. View visualizations, explore further analysis, and customize feature engineering as desired.

 Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with code and explanations
- Dataset file (CSV)
- Screenshots of visualizations
